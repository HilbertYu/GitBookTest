# Definition

* **Graph**:  A **graph** is a pair of sets, V, E, $$G=G(V,E)$$. There $$V$$ is the set of vertices and $$E$$ is the set of edges.  Suppose $$V = \{a_i| i = 1\dots n\}$$ ($$V$$ may be a empty set. 


Let $$e\in E$$. $$e = e(a_i, a_j)$$ is a edge formed by $$a_i$$, $$a_j$$. $$e$$ is **undirected** if $$e(a_i, a_j) = e(a_j, a_i)$$. We let it be denoted by $$(a_i, a_j)$$. Otherwise, we use the symbol $$<a_i, a_j>$$, where $$a_i$$ is the *tail* and $$a_j$$ is the *head*.
